1) You need to install VirtualBox — this should be straight forward. 
Configure your VM with as much RAM and disk space as you find acceptable, 
without compromizing your host machine. I.e. with 8GB RAM on host, probably 
allocate only 2-3GB on your VM. You’ll need about 25 gigs for disk space 
(auto-extendable is a “good” option).

2) You then need to install the latest Ubuntu (v 18.x, desktop edition) on 
you freshly acquired Virtual (linux) machine. NB: do NOT(!) install updates 
from Ubuntu once you’re up and running. It might end up crashing on update. 
Follow the instructions here:

Now you can go ahead and get the software, from your Ubuntu Desktop (use a 
‘terminal’) running on your virtual machine. NB: do NOT(!) update/upgrade the 
pip3 installer (default version should be 9.0if notified — it will mess up 
your entire setup. So do:
	~$ sudo apt-get install git
	~$ sudo apt-get install python3
	~$ sudo apt-get install jupyter-notebook
	~$ sudo pip3 install numpy
	~$ sudo pip3 install scikit-learn
	~$ sudo pip3 install scikit-image
	~$ sudo pip3 install matplotlib
	~$ sudo pip3 install keras
	~$ sudo pip3 install tensorflow

Now you should be able to run Jupyter Notebooks on your Ubuntu machine:
	~$ jupyter notebook

And you can fetch the deep dream notebook here: 
https://github.com/Jegp/keras_deepdream . Run that dreaming experiment. You 
may run out of memory since the image requires tensorflow to allocate a lot 
of RAM. If so, you can downsize the image (use python, to reshape the image 
before “dreaming” it). Or you can give your virtual machine (in Virtual Box 
config) more RAM, but you don’t want to give it too much since that will 
freeze your host (your actual computer).
