## Machine Learning & AI - Spring 2019

----------------
### Week 05
* Announcements -- fx about weeklies like this one you're reading -- are given through the Moodle flow.
* Course information and material is availble though the course's Moodle flow.

**Main Subject:** Introduction to the course, expectations, infrastructure, the overall plan for the semester. Simple ML, Pythonics, a few exercises.

**Subject & Goal:** 

**Estimated need for activity out side classroom:** You should probably spend some N-to-M hours outside class. The concepts' briefings are extremely central, yet brief, in this course, so be careful to read (and read again) the chapters of the 100 Page ML Book .

-----------------
### Resources
**Reading:** Chapter 1 of the '100 Page ML Book', read it carefully.

**Lecture Slides:** are available on GitHub.

**Code:** you should do this yourselves, and understand the steps -- roughly (data -> model -> training (or weight loading) -> inferrance -> result. It is required that you team up for the exercises. It is even recommended that you do so outside of class too for companionship through the coming semesters. You can get much further, faster, if you're helping eahcother to ideas. Code will largely be drawn from the [Python supplementary book website]().

**Classroom activity:** Python stuff, some of which is in the context of the Chapters 1 and 2 of reading material (the 100 Page ML Book).

**Workshop Hours:** I will be settling on a module during the week, where I will be stationed in a room/office space on the CPHBUS campus, so that we might get a chance to look over the things that you (or I) are wondering about. It will be announced on the Moodle Flow ASAP.
