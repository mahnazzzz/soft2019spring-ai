## Machine Learning & AI - Spring 2019

### Week 06

Announcements and general information is available through the [Moodle flow](https://cphbusiness.mrooms.net/enrol/index.php?id=3151). 

----------------

### Focus this week

- **Create a Common Platform(!):** We have decided that we continue the course work using VirtualBox+Ubuntu18 desktop. That way we be sure to be on the same page. You can find instructions on how to install that platform [here](https://github.com/datsoftlyngby/soft2019spring-ai/blob/master/Notes/Instructs_MLAI_VB_Ubuntu18.txt). 
- Python in jupyter notebooks, math of the business, ...

-----------------

### Classroom Activities 

- Infrastructure, is everyone up-tro-speed? Checking up on:
  * **Python** devel environment,
  * **Jupyter Notebooks** working installation,
  * **Github** access and usage,
  * **Peergrade** access and usage.
 
- Mentimeter (instructions will be given in class):
  - Are we close to (but not in!) our comfort zone? 
  - Instructions on how to join the poll will be given in class.

- Student Q & A session on the 1st exercises and general introduction, to make sure we're all clear on how to progress.
- We will loosely review the exercises and code from last week, by peer presentation and discussion, to see how far we could get during the Introduction week.
- Basic pythonics, deep-dream example.

**Estimated need for activity out side classroom:** Some 6 hours outside class, including reading -- remember that the book is only 100 pages, but very densly written! The concepts of the ML process and various calsses of learning (supervised, un-supervised, etc.) should be fairly well established by Week 6.

-----------------
### Resources

**Reading:** For this week, you should read Chapters 1 & 2 of the '100 Page ML Book'.

**Lecture Slides:** coming soon ...

**Code:** you should do the exercises **with your group**, from scratch, although some assistance is available through central [online resources](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2).

**Classroom exercises:** TBD (to-be-determined) -- but will be taken in context of the chapter 1 and 2 of the reading material, i.e. the '100 Page ML Book' and the supplmentary online resources for the book ['Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & Tensorflow'](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2).

**Workshop Hours:** we will settle for a weekly time slot, when I will be stationed in a room/office space on the CPHBUS campus, so that we might get a chance to look over the things that you (or I) are wondering about. It will be announced on the Moodle Flow ASAP, after we've made a decision during class this week (week 6) over Mentimeter.
